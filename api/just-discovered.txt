  <h2>Introducing Just-Discovered Links beta:</h2>
  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      A new report that helps you identify recently created URLs and links. The Just-Discovered Links report indexes URLs within about one hour of being shared on Twitter, as well as the URLs linked from those tweeted pages. URLs that display a Page Authority score are in the Mozscape index or have been included previously; URLs marked "[No data]" are ones we've just discovered. This report is currently in beta mode; please keep this in mind when determining how to use this data in your workflow.
